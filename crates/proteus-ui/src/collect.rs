//! Instance collection — bridges ECS `QuadState` to GPU-ready `QuadInstance` data.
//!
//! The render loop's job is a two-step bridge:
//!
//! 1. [`collect_instances`] — reads the ECS world and returns a `Vec<QuadInstance>`
//!    that represents every visible entity, ready for the GPU.
//! 2. The shell passes that vec to `QuadPipeline::upload_instances` and then draws.
//!
//! ## Two instances per text entity
//!
//! An entity with a [`BakedText`] component emits **two** `QuadInstance`s:
//!
//! | Layer | UV | Color |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Background | `WHITE_PIXEL_UV` | `QuadState::color` (solid fill) |
//! | Text overlay | `BakedText::uv_offset / uv_scale` | `Text::color` (defaults to white) |
//!
//! Plain quads (no `BakedText`) emit one instance: the solid-color background only.
//! Virtual entities created during group transitions may have a `BakedText` component
//! propagated from their source entity.  In that case the text overlay instance has its
//! `opacity` reduced proportionally to the transition progress so the source text
//! dissolves smoothly rather than snapping off at the end.
//!
//! ## Drop shadow
//!
//! When a [`DropShadow`] component is present on an entity it is applied to the
//! **background** instance only.  The text overlay instance always has
//! `shadow_color.a = 0` (no shadow) so that the shadow does not double-render
//! beneath the glyph layer.
//!
//! ## Glow (M8.6)
//!
//! When a [`Glow`] component is present and no [`DropShadow`] is present,
//! the glow is encoded into the same `shadow_params`/`shadow_color` slots with
//! a zero offset (producing a symmetric halo).  If both are present, `DropShadow`
//! takes precedence.
//!
//! ## Border
//!
//! When a [`Border`] component is present its `width`/`color`/`offset` are copied
//! directly into the instance's `border_width`/`border_color`/`border_offset`
//! fields — independent of shadow/glow, so all three can be present at once.
//!
//! ## Baked texture crossfade (two-sided)
//!
//! When a [`BakedTexture`] component is present, its `from_*` fields become
//! the background instance's `base_uv_offset`/`base_uv_scale` and its `to_*`
//! fields become `uv_offset`/`uv_scale` (with `atlas_page` forced to `1` —
//! `transition_atlas` holds both sides). `crossfade_t` is driven from the
//! entity's own [`ActiveTransition`] progress each frame. Used by
//! transition-bake virtual slices (see `topology`) so a slice crossfades
//! texel-for-texel from an actual cropped snapshot of the source entity's
//! rendered appearance to an actual snapshot of its target's rendered
//! appearance — shape, border, *and* text on both ends — rather than a
//! flat-color approximation on either side.
//!
//! ## Video (M9)
//!
//! When a [`crate::VideoPlayer`] component is present the background instance's
//! `atlas_page` is set to `2` and the UV is set to cover the full `video_atlas`
//! texture.  The entity's `QuadState::color` acts as a tint; use `Vec4::ONE`
//! (white) for unfiltered video.  Any `BakedText` overlay is still emitted on
//! top as a second instance so labels can float above the video.
//!
//! ## Visibility
//!
//! Entities with [`Visibility::HIDDEN`] are excluded from the output. Entities with
//! no `Visibility` component at all are treated as visible (the default).
