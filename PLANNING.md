# Proteus — Planning

The decisions and definitions of done for the work underway. [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) gives
the order of the releases and the candidates for what comes next.

## How this document works

- **It records decisions and definitions of done.** A decision says what was decided and when,
  in a paragraph at most. A definition of done is a checklist, ticked as the work lands.
- **Reasoning longer than a paragraph goes in a design note,** in
  [docs/design/](./docs/design/README.md), linked from here: what was found or measured, the
  approaches weighed, and how to tell whether a change worked.
- **The design v0.1.0 settled is described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md),** with its
  key decisions. Changing one of them is a decision, recorded here.
- **The planning for v0.1.0, milestones M0 to M14, is archived** in
  [docs/archive/](./docs/archive/), as history. Nothing here depends on it.

## Release planning

Decides the releases: which of ROADMAP's candidates each takes, and in what order. Until it's
done, the candidates are unordered.

- **Decided (2026-10-15): releases, not milestones.** Now that Proteus is released, work is
  planned by version, each release with a theme and features of its own. Milestone numbers end
  at M14. "V2" in older documents means everything after v0.1.0, not a release.
- **Decided (2026-10-15): a release's scope is fixed.** It ships when its features are done,
  not on a date. Small fixes ride along in the next feature release, or, if found after a
  release ships, go out in a patch release.
- **Decided (2026-10-15): candidates are weighed in this order:** fixing known limits and known
  issues; what outside developers need to build real apps; effects, such as blur; then other
  platforms.
- **Decided (2026-10-15): the origin stays at the viewport's center, with y up.** Instead of
  moving it, Rust gets equivalents of TypeScript's `topLeftToWorld` and `worldToTopLeft`, and
  the guides make the origin and the conversion clear in both languages. Nothing breaks.
- **Decided (2026-10-15): dogfooding is off the roadmap.** A personal website built with Proteus
  happens outside it, and what it finds comes back to ROADMAP as candidates.
- **Decided (2026-10-19): work independent of a release is tracked in ROADMAP too,** in a
  section of its own. Rewriting the history to shrink the repository is the first such task,
  done early.
- [x] ROADMAP and PLANNING plan by release rather than milestone.
- [ ] Every candidate in ROADMAP is placed in a release, kept as a candidate for later, or
  dropped with a reason.
- [ ] The releases are in ROADMAP in order, each with a definition of done here.
- [ ] The two high-priority candidates, the shader fast path and rounded corners on baked
  slices, are decided first.

## Standing decisions

- **Non-interactive and disabled components ignore all input** (2026-09-28), not just the
  pointer: mouse, touch, pen, keyboard, gamepad and TV remote. The Rust and TypeScript docs for
  making a component non-interactive or disabled state this, noting that only pointer input
  exists today. When keyboard navigation or any other input is built, focus and every other input
  path must skip non-interactive and disabled components, and those notes must be updated to
  match.
